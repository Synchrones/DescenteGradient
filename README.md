This code is part of a project I had with 5 others students during my second year post bac.

The aim was to understand the maths and algorithms behind the way AIs can learn.

We recreated the famous backpropagation algorithm and used it to train a model to recognize pictures with or without bottles as a way do demonstrate how it could be used to detect pollution.
